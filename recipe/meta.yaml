  summary: a fork of Python 2 and 3 ast modules with type comment support
  description: |
    typed_ast is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and Python 3
    parser similar to the standard ast library. Unlike ast, the parsers in
    typed_ast include PEP 484 type comments and are independent of the version
    of Python under which they are run. The typed_ast parsers produce the
    standard Python AST (plus type comments), and are both fast and correct, as
    they are based on the CPython 2.7 and 3.6 parsers.
